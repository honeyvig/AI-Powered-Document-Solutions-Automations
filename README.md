To automate the development of a comprehensive system that covers the following points (Roadmap & Planning, Feature Development, Database Development, PDF-Specific Features, Admin Panel & Dashboard, and UI/UX Implementation), a combination of code structure, best practices, and automation tools must be implemented. Below is an outline of the Python code structure and tasks for automating this process. This will be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces, each with specific responsibilities.

The code provided below isn't a full implementation but instead a framework to guide development and automation of each stage of your project.
Step-by-Step Automation Framework
1. Roadmap & Planning: Automating Milestone Tracking

You can use a Python-based framework to collaborate on roadmap and milestones. This can be automated using task management tools like Jira (via their API), Trello, or GitHub Projects to create tasks and track progress.
Code to Automate Roadmap Tracking:

import requests
import json

# Define the URL for your task management tool's API (e.g., Trello, Jira, or GitHub API)
API_URL = "https://api.trello.com/1/cards"  # Replace with your platform's API URL

# Define your API Key and Token for Trello or any task management service.
API_KEY = "your_api_key"
TOKEN = "your_oauth_token"

# Function to create a task
def create_task(list_id, task_name, task_description):
    payload = {
        "name": task_name,
        "desc": task_description,
        "idList": list_id,
        "key": API_KEY,
        "token": TOKEN
    }
    response = requests.post(API_URL, params=payload)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
task_name = "Integrate AI Providers"
task_description = "Integrate multiple AI providers for responses"
list_id = "your_list_id"  # Trello list ID or corresponding list from your task manager

# Create the task
create_task(list_id, task_name, task_description)

This example automates creating tasks in Trello or another project management platform. You can use similar methods for other platforms like Jira or GitHub Projects.
2. Feature Development: Integrating AI Providers, Logging, and Document Features
Integrating Multiple AI Providers

To integrate AI providers, you can use Python libraries like openai, huggingface, or others depending on the providers you're working with. Here's an example of calling multiple AI providers:

import openai
from transformers import pipeline

# OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-3)
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

def get_openai_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Huggingface AI provider
huggingface_pipeline = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

def get_huggingface_response(prompt):
    return huggingface_pipeline(prompt, max_length=100)[0]['generated_text']

# Example usage
openai_response = get_openai_response("What is the weather like?")
huggingface_response = get_huggingface_response("Explain machine learning.")

print("OpenAI Response:", openai_response)
print("Huggingface Response:", huggingface_response)

3. Database Development: Setting up SQL and Pinecone Database
SQL Database Setup

Use libraries like SQLAlchemy to handle your relational SQL databases. Here is an example of setting up a user database:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Database connection string
DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///users.db'  # For SQLite, replace with your DB URI for others
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URI, echo=True)

Base = declarative_base()

# Define a User model
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

# Create tables
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Example usage: Add a new user
new_user = User(name="John Doe", email="john@example.com")
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()

Pinecone Database Setup

For integrating a Pinecone vector database:

import pinecone

# Initialize Pinecone environment
pinecone.init(api_key="your_pinecone_api_key", environment="us-west1-gcp")

# Create or connect to a Pinecone index
index_name = "documents"
index = pinecone.Index(index_name)

# Insert a vector into the Pinecone index
vector_data = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]  # Example vector data
index.upsert(vectors=[("document_1", vector_data)])

# Query the Pinecone index
query = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
results = index.query(queries=[query], top_k=3)
print(results)

4. PDF-Specific Features: Toolbar, AI-assisted Document Search

Use libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfminer for parsing and enhancing PDFs.

import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in doc:
        text += page.get_text()
    return text

# Example usage
pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf("example.pdf")
print(pdf_text)

For adding search functionality to PDFs, you can implement a search feature:

def search_text_in_pdf(pdf_path, search_term):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    found_text = []
    for page_num, page in enumerate(doc):
        if search_term.lower() in page.get_text().lower():
            found_text.append(f"Found on page {page_num + 1}")
    return found_text

# Example usage
search_results = search_text_in_pdf("example.pdf", "AI")
print(search_results)

5. Admin Panel & Dashboard: Monitoring User Activities

For monitoring and creating an admin panel, you could use Flask or Django for a web-based dashboard.
Flask Dashboard Example:

from flask import Flask, render_template
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def dashboard():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    users = cursor.fetchall()
    return render_template("dashboard.html", users=users)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

6. UI/UX Implementation: Landing Pages, Layouts

For this part, you would typically work with Figma designs. To implement these layouts, you can integrate front-end frameworks like Flask (for web apps), or use libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for desktop apps.
7. Automation of Tasks (CI/CD)

To automate the deployment process, use CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

Example of a GitHub Action for automatic deployment:

name: Deploy to Heroku

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Deploy to Heroku
        run: |
          git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-app.git
          git push heroku main

Conclusion:

This code framework offers an overview of how to approach automating and developing each part of the system. While not exhaustive, it provides a good base for various tasks like AI integration, database setup, PDF parsing, and dashboard management. Each section can be expanded based on specific requirements and technologies used in your project.
